## Initial slice dispositions

| Source path | Disposition | Target path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lab/src/lab/studies/common/statistics.py` | MOVE (copy-first rehearsal) | `src/lab/studies/common/statistics.py` | Pure descriptive/paired scalar summaries; source-path commit `13720935595fedabec2c376dc933629b0deae5aa`; copied bytes verified identical. |
| `lab/src/lab/studies/common/pairing.py` | MOVE (copy-first rehearsal) | `src/lab/studies/common/pairing.py` | Enforces seed pairing and disjointness for study design; source-path commit `13720935595fedabec2c376dc933629b0deae5aa`; copied bytes verified identical. |
| `lab/tests/unit/lab/test_common_stats.py` | MOVE (copy-first rehearsal) | `tests/test_statistics.py` | Existing focused unit tests; source-path commit `282c44eea894faedb57763c3545a1401cf032a86`; copied bytes identical. |
| `lab/tests/experimental_integrity/test_pairing.py` | MOVE (copy-first rehearsal) | `tests/test_pairing.py` | Existing focused seed-pairing checks; source-path commit `282c44eea894faedb57763c3545a1401cf032a86`; copied bytes identical. |

No new Git history is claimed for copied modules. Provenance is the pinned source
SHA and paths above. Source repository remains unchanged.

## Deferred / excluded

| Source area | Disposition | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lab/studies/**` beyond the two common utilities | DEFER | Individual studies have runtime dependencies, experimental conditions and protocols requiring their own transfer review. No study protocol or output is copied here. |
| `lab/experiments/**` | DEFER | Runner, registry, manifests and workspace interact with source layout, runtime composition and persistence/provenance. |
| `lab/physics3d/**`, `lab/integration/**`, `lab/world/**` | DEFER | Mixed physical substrate, semantic authorities and runtime orchestration; not safe for bulk transfer. |
| `lab/observation/**`, `lab/observatory/**`, `lab/server/**`, `lab/app/**` | DEFER | Observation, transport, evidence custody and UI boundaries require separate extraction. |
| CLI and reproduction code | DEFER | Entrypoints and reproduction callers are mixed with CURRENT runtime authorities/interventions. |
| Scientific assets, manifests and run/checkpoint payloads | DROP from this repo scope | No scientific artifacts are copied or relocated. This does not determine their preservation disposition. |

## Known rewrites

- Copied module bytes are unchanged.
- Test files are rewritten to exercise the extracted package namespace (`lab`).
- Distribution/import name is `lab`; no `biopeia_*` prefix is used.
- This narrow utility slice is an extraction rehearsal, not a complete Lab repo migration or authority claim.

## Validation

Build/install/test results are recorded in the migration PR and checks. No
experiments were executed and no scientific assets were moved.
